# Choose your side - Team Gyrados
# DataScience-LOL-DOTA-Analysis 

In this study, we investigated people's attack and defense orientations in MOBA games.
To explore these trends, we selected two very popular games: LoL and Dota.
We used machine learning algorithms and data visualization in our study. 
We used Python as the programming language. 
In order to run our code over Python, you need to download some libraries and datasets.

below is a list of libraries you need to download
and their addresses you can find on the internet

pandas			https://pypi.org/project/pandas/
numpy			https://pypi.org/project/numpy/
matplotlib.pyplot	https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/
seaborn			https://pypi.org/project/seaborn/
mpl_scatter_density	https://pypi.org/project/mpl-scatter-density/
sklearn.cluster 	https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/
graphviz		https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/

If the libraries are not available on your computer,
you need to run the command line codes found on the given internet addresses.

Below are the internet addresses of the datasets you need to download
